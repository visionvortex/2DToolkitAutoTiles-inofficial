# 2DToolkitAutoTiles-inofficial
This repository contains a c# autotiling script for the Unity extension 2DToolKit by "Unikron Software" (http://www.2dtoolkit.com/) for use with Unity 5 and above.

To use this script you need to:
1. Buy a license for 2DToolkit if oyu don't own one.
2. Import 2DToolkit to your project.
3. Add the files of this repository to the project.

To check how the setup works, please refer to the demo scene that is included in .\tk2dAutoTiles\DemoTileMap.

This script needs a very specific setup for the tilemap since it allows for single width walls. Please check TilesetTemplate.png included in .\tk2dAutoTiles\SpriteSheetTemplate.
